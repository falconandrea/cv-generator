- [x] **Foundation**: Removed Laravel refs, refactored store.
- [x] **Frontend Redesign**: Created Landing Page, Editor Sidebar, Split View.
- [x] **Core Features**: Added Languages support to Store, Form, and PDF.
- [x] **Bug Fixes**: Fixed layout, mobile menu, alerts (Toasts/Modals), PDF preview.

## Current Context
- **Goal**: Layout Redesign (next session).
- **Next Up**: Rework editor desktop layout — current 3-column (menu | form | preview) is too cramped. Proposed: top navigation tabs (section menu), left = form, right = PDF preview (wider). Discuss exact breakpoints and tab style before implementing.

## Backlog
- Implement AI Integration (Phase 4): setup API route and AI client.
