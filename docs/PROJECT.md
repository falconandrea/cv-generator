## Project info

### Goal

Build a web application that allows users to generate **ATS-optimized CVs** by filling structured sections and exporting a clean, professional PDF.

The application is designed for:

- No authentication
- No database
- Local-only state
- Maximum ATS compatibility

---

## Key Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These rules **must never be violated**, as they directly impact ATS parsing:

- One-column layout only
- Text-only PDF (no images, icons, charts)
- No tables
- No multi-column grids
- Standard fonts only (Helvetica → Arial → sans-serif)
- Clear section headings
- Bullet points using simple hyphens
- Clickable text links (mailto / https)

---

## Sections

### Experience (Sortable)

Each experience entry contains:

- Company name
